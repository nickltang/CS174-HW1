# CS174-HW1
Basic HTML website for CS 174. Group: Nick Tang, Tiffany Phan, Ethan Deguzman

## Instructions
I would like you to make a website written using only modern HTML (no Javascript and no server side scripts) consisting of at least three pages. The theme for these pages should be connected to your political campaign to run for meme-catcher (not related to K-Pop group Dreamcatcher). You should image it is the far-future, so people no-longer run for dog-catcher/animal control. Instead, they try to control insidiously silly memes.
